# Core Metrics & KPI Philosophy

Nevoya's operational excellence is measured by five core metrics. These aren't just numbers — they represent our commitment to customers, drivers, and sustainable growth.

---

## The Driver Manager's Scorecard

Every Driver Manager is accountable for these metrics across their assigned fleet (8-12 drivers):

| Metric | Target | Strategic Imperative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue per Truck/Day** | $1,000 | Protect Revenue |
| **On-Time Delivery (OTD)** | 95%+ | Delight Customers |
| **Driver Utilization** | 85%+ | Maximize Efficiency |
| **Customer Response Time** | < 30 min | Service Excellence |
| **Data Accuracy** | 100% | Operational Integrity |

---

## 1. Revenue Target: $1,000/Truck/Day

### What It Means

Every truck in your fleet should generate **$1,000 in revenue per day**. This is the financial foundation of Nevoya's business model.

### Your Impact

| Action | Revenue Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Execute loads efficiently | Maximizes billable miles |
| Minimize downtime between loads | Reduces empty time |
| Avoid detention through proactive communication | Protects schedule integrity |
| Escalate maintenance issues early | Prevents lost revenue days |

### How to Track

- Review daily revenue per truck in Apollo dashboards
- Flag any truck consistently below $900/day to Ops Lead
- Identify patterns: Is it driver efficiency, route quality, or equipment issues?

---

## 2. On-Time Delivery: 95%+

### What It Means

**95% of all loads must arrive within the appointment window.** This is our promise to customers and the foundation of repeat business.

### Your Impact

| Action | OTD Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Complete Morning Pulse checklist | Catches problems before they cause delays |
| Monitor Yellow Flags (15+ min deviations) | Enables recovery before customer impact |
| Communicate proactively with customers | Manages expectations, preserves trust |
| Escalate early when OTD is at risk | Gets help before it's too late |

### The Golden Rule

> **The customer should never have to ask "Where's my load?"**
>
> If you're communicating proactively, they already know.

### How to Track

- OTD is calculated automatically in Apollo
- Any load delivered outside the appointment window counts against OTD
- Review your fleet's OTD weekly and identify repeat offenders (lanes, facilities, drivers)

---

## 3. Driver Utilization: 85%+

### What It Means

Drivers should be **productively engaged 85% of their available hours**. This includes driving, loading/unloading, and required breaks — not sitting idle.

### Your Impact

| Action | Utilization Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Minimize empty miles through execution | More revenue per hour |
| Reduce facility wait times | More driving time |
| Coordinate efficient relay handoffs (TX) | Maximizes both drivers' time |
| Flag underutilized drivers to Planning | Enables route optimization |

### What Kills Utilization

- Excessive detention at facilities (flag if >90 min)
- Poor route sequencing (Planning issue — escalate)
- Driver no-shows or late starts (address immediately)
- Equipment breakdowns (escalate to Maintenance)

---

## 4. Customer Response Time: < 30 Minutes

### What It Means

Every customer inquiry in **Front** must receive a response within **30 minutes** during business hours.

### Your Impact

| Action | Response Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Monitor Front inbox throughout shift | Catches inquiries early |
| Use Apollo data to answer quickly | Provides accurate, immediate info |
| Tag threads correctly | Ensures proper handoff between shifts |
| Escalate complex issues promptly | Avoids delays on hard questions |

### Response Quality Standards

| Type | Expected Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| Check-call request | Current location, ETA, any issues |
| Appointment change | Confirmation of new time, driver notified |
| Status update | Load stage, ETA, proactive issue flag |
| Complaint | Acknowledgment, investigation, follow-up timeline |

---

## 5. Data Accuracy: 100%

### What It Means

**Every timestamp in Apollo must be accurate within 15 minutes of the actual event.** This data powers dashboards, customer portals, and billing.

### Your Impact

| Action | Data Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Log arrival/departure immediately | Real-time visibility for all stakeholders |
| Flag detention (>90 min at facility) | Enables billing recovery |
| Document all exceptions with notes | Creates accountability trail |
| Complete shift handoff notes | Ensures continuity |

### The Data Hygiene Rule

> **If it's not in Apollo, it didn't happen.**
>
> Dashboards, customer reports, and billing all depend on YOUR data entry.

### Critical Timestamps

| Event | Log Within |
| :--- | :--- |
| Arrival at pickup | 15 minutes |
| Departure from pickup | 15 minutes |
| Arrival at delivery | 15 minutes |
| Departure from delivery | 15 minutes |
| Any exception or delay | Immediately |

## Metric Review Cadence

| Frequency | Review | Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily** | Individual load performance | Driver Manager |
| **Weekly** | Fleet OTD and utilization trends | Driver Manager + Ops Lead |
| **Monthly** | Revenue per truck, customer satisfaction | Ops Lead + GM |
| **Quarterly** | Strategic KPI targets and adjustments | Leadership |

## The Bottom Line

These five metrics work together:

```
Revenue ($1,000/truck)
    ↑
    │ Enabled by
    │
┌───┴────────────────────────────────┐
│                                    │
│  OTD (95%+)  ←→  Utilization (85%+)│
│       ↑              ↑             │
│       │              │             │
│  Response Time   Data Accuracy     │
│    (< 30 min)       (100%)         │
│                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fast response** enables **on-time delivery**.
**Accurate data** enables **utilization optimization**.
**Both together** protect **$1,000/truck/day**.
