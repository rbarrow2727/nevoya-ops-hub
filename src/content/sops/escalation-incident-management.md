In the event of an accident, cargo claim, or major safety incident:
1. **Ensure Safety**: Instruct driver to move to a safe location if possible and call emergency services if needed.
2. **Notify Safety Lead**: Call the Safety Hotline immediately.
3. **Notify Leadership**: Use the #urgent Slack channel.

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Breakdowns
